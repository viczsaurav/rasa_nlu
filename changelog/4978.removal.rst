Remove option ``use_cls_token`` from tokenizers and option ``return_sequence`` from featurizers.

By default all tokenizer add a special token (``__CLS__``) to the end of the list of tokens.
This token will be used to capture the features of the whole utterance.

The featurizers will return a matrix of size (number-of-tokens x feature-dimension) by default.
This allows to train sequence models.
However, the feature vector of the ``__CLS__`` token can be used to train non-sequence models.
The corresponding classifier can decide what kind of features to use.
