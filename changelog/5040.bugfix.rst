Updated the dependency ``networkx`` from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0. The old version created incompatibilities when using pip. 

There is an imcompatibility between Rasa dependecy requests 2.22.0 and the own depedency from Rasa for networkx raising errors upon pip install. There is also a bug corrected in ``requirements.txt`` which used ``~=`` instead of ``==``. All of these are fixed using networkx 2.4.0.
