Test Domain and Data Files for Mistakes
---------------------------------------

To verify if there are any mistakes in your domain file, NLU data, or story data, run the validate script.
You can run it with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  rasa data validate

The script above runs all the validations on your files. Here is the list of options to
the script:

.. program-output:: rasa data validate --help

By default the validator searches only for errors in the data (e.g. the same
example being listed as an example for two intents), but does not report other
minor issues (such as unused intents, utterances that are not listed as
actions). To also report the later use the ``-debug`` flag.

You can also run these validations through the Python API by importing the `Validator` class,
which has the following methods:

**from_files():** Creates the instance from string paths to the necessary files.

**verify_intents():** Checks if intents listed in domain file are consistent with the NLU data.

**verify_example_repetition_in_intents():** Checks if there is no duplicated data among distinct intents at NLU data.

**verify_intents_in_stories():** Verification for intents in the stories, to check if they are valid.

**verify_utterances():** Checks domain file for consistency between utterance templates and utterances listed under
actions.

**verify_utterances_in_stories():** Verification for utterances in stories, to check if they are valid.

**verify_all():** Runs all verifications above.

**verify_domain_validity():** Check if domain is valid.

To use these functions it is necessary to create a `Validator` object and initialize the logger. See the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  import logging
  from rasa import utils
  from rasa.core.validator import Validator

  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  utils.configure_colored_logging('DEBUG')

  validator = Validator.from_files(domain_file='domain.yml',
                                   nlu_data='data/nlu_data.md',
                                   stories='data/stories.md')

  validator.verify_all()
